1) IPv4 Structure
2) IP Classes
3) Public vs Private IP
4) IPv4 vs IPv6



== 1 IPv4 Structure ==

	- IP Address version 4
	- Resides in Network Layer (TCP/IP)
	
	- Any device in network must have unique IP address to be identified
	
	- 32 bit (dotted-decimal) number
	- 4-octet, 1 octet = 8 bits
	
	- Only possible to have ~ 4 billion IP Address for IPv4
	
	
	eg:
	
	192.168.12.34
	
		- Divided into 2 parts
			1) Network ID
			2) Host ID
			
		eg: 
		
		192.168 : Network ID
		12.34 : Host ID
			
		- Split dependent on the IPv4 class
	
	
	
== 2 IPv4 Classes ==
	1 byte = 8 bits = 1 octet`
	8 bits = 256 different binary combinations (i.e max decimal = 255)
	min decimal = 0
	max decimal = 255
	
	HOST VS NETWORK
	HOST: Device connected to a network
	NETWORK: Made up of multiple devices, each having an IP address
	
Class A

	Range: 
		[Network ID].[Host ID].[Host ID].[Host ID]
		- First Block : 1 to 126
		- No. Network possible: 126
		- No. of Host possible: 2^8 * 2^8 * 2^8 = 16 777 216
		- Dedicated to very large networks
			- IBM | GE | AT&T etc.
		- first bit always 0

* IP Address 127 saved for loopback (Localhost)
	- Any packets sent to 127 is looped back
	
Class B
	Range:
		[Network ID].[Network ID].[Host ID].[Host ID]
		- First Block : 128 to 191
		- No of Network possible: 16 384 (2^(16-2)) (first 2 bits used as 10)
		- No of Host possible: 65 534 (2 ^ 16)
		- first 2 bits always 10
		
Class C
	Range:
		[Network ID].[Network ID].[Network ID].[Host ID]
		- First block: 192 to 223
		- No of Network possible: 2 097 152 (2^(24-3)) (first 3 bits used as 110)
		- No of Host possible: 254 (1 bit dedicated to network, 1 bit for broadcast)
			- 256 - 1 - 1 = 254

Class D (multicast)
Class E (Research & Development use)



* Only the first block has limitations
* The other 3 blocks can vary from 0 to 255



== 3 Public IP vs Private IP ==

	Private IP:
		- within local network
		- Not connected to internet
		
		10.0.0.0
		172.16.0.0
		192.168.0.0
		
	Public IP:
		- connected to internet
		- follows the different classes convention
		
		
== 4 IPv4 vs IPv6 ==

	- IPv4
		- 32 bits
		- 4 billion addresses
		- Subnetting helps to prolong usage of IPv4
		
	- IPv6
		- 128 bits
		- 340 trillion trillion trillion ip addresses
		- if 1 billion ip address assigned per second, need 3.4e29 seconds
		- written in hexadecimal format (8 groups of 16 bits each)
		- 2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:ff00:0042:9321
