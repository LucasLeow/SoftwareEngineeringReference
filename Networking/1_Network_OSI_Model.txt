OSI : Open System Interconnect (ISO standard)
	- since 1976, used in 1986
	- Network framework for data communication between different devices
	- With this knowledge, can troubleshoot networking error easier
		- given error message, roughly know which layer error originates
	- Theoretical Model
	- TCP/IP Model more practical
		- Merging of some layers together
		
	

7) Application Layer  - General - Send message ("Enemy is Near")
6) Presentation Layer - Brigadier
5) Session Layer 	  -	Colonel
4) Transport Layer    -	Major
3) Network Layer      -	Captain
2) Data Link Layer    -	Lieutenant
1) Physical Layer     -	Cadet


Sending Information: Top to Btm (7 to 1)
	- Request sent (by client)
	
Receiving Information: Btm to Top (1 to 7)
	- Request received (by server)
	
	
Mnemonic:
	(A)ll (P)eople (S)hould (T)ry (N)ew (D)omino (P)izza
	

	General Understanding Storyline:
		- General wants to send message to another General
		- need to follow chain of command (protocol)
		
		1) General's message ("Enemy is Near") <- Request (Application layer)
		
		2) Brigadier encrypt message ("Eagle is Napping") (Presentation Layer)
		
		3) Colonel 1 calls Colonel 2 to inform of incoming msg (Session Layer) (Opens link)
			- so that gate of HQ2 will open for HQ1 cadet
			- communication channel set up b/w HQ1 & HQ2
			
		4) Major 1 divides msg into segments & attaches destination address to segment
			- (Transport Layer)
			- segments are pushed into a queue & send sent to Captain
			
				[Building105][Eagle] [Building105][is] [Building105][Napping]
			
		5) Captain 1 processes each segment from Major 1
			- Captain 1 plans the route for segment to be transported (Routing details)
			- Cadet will have to follow this route plan assigned
			- Route optimized for safety & efficiency & speed
			- (Network Layer)
			
				[Route1][Building105][Eagle] <- Packet

		6) Packet passed to Lieutenant 1 (Data Link Layer)
			- Lieutenant 1 adds [Door Number] to packet
			- Door which info must go through
			
				[Door5][Route1][Building105][Eagle]
				
		7) Finalized packet passed to Cadet 1 (Physical Layer)
			- Cadet 1 will binarize the packet
			- Cadet 1 will transport binary to Cadet 2 following info on packet
			- Cadet 2 will decode the binary back to packet info
			
			
		Data -> Segments -> Packets -> Frames -> Bits (Sending)
		
		Bits -> Frames -> Packets -> Segments -> Data (Receiving)
		
- OSI ensures data:
	- reaches on time
	- reaches securely
	



== Actual OSI Theory ==

Software Layers: (Application Firewall | VPN | SSL | Proxies)

	7) Application Layer (User App Layer)
		- closest to end-user
		- HTTP | FTP | SMTP etc.
		
	6) Presentation Layer
		- compresses | encrypts to appropriate format
		- .ASCII | .DOCX | .JPEG etc.
		
	5) Session Layer
		- Open & Closes session
		- Establishes connection b/w sender & receiver
		- ensures proper authorization / authentication
		- RPC | TLS protocol etc.
			- Request-Response protocol (RPC)
			- Transport Layer Security (TLS)
			- Single Sign On (SSO)
 	
Interface Layer (B/w Hardware & Software)

	4) Transport Layer (Load Balancers & Network Firewall)
		- Ensure perfect delivery of message
		- Add Transport Header to Data
			- Port Details (Port 80 etc.)
			- Database Port etc.
		- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
			- waits for mutual handshake before sending data
		- UDP (User Datagram Protocol) 
			- just send data without handshake
			- realtime video streaming
	
Hardware Layers:

	3) Network Layer (Routers) + (Layer 3 switches)
		- Add Network header into packet
		- decide the route for packet to travel
			- the IP address of destination
			
	2) Data Link Layer (NIC Switches) (Layer 2 switches)
		- Ensure error free & in sequence delivery of packets
		- MAC address added to Packet
			- each device have own unique MAC address
		- Packet divided into frames
		- Ethernet Protocol (MAC | LLC)
			- Media Access Control (MAC)
			- Logic Link Control (LLC)
				- ensure error free delivery
				- frame check sequence

	1) Physical Layer (RJ 45)
		- actual network cable
		- converts frame to bits (binary) (electric signals)
		- voltage pulse transported via cables





TCP/IP Model (More Practical Model)
	- Only 4 layers (Merging of some layers)
	
	4) Application Layer
		- Application
		- Presentation
		- Session
		
	3) Transport Layer
	2) Network Layer
	
	1) Physical Layer
		- Data Link
		- Physical
