DHCP : Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol

	- How devices get IP address
	- Assigns unique IP Address to any device connected to the network
	- Any server, even router, can perform DHCP to assign IP address
	
	
	
	4 Steps (DHCP) To know device get IP Address when connected to network:
		
		* Any network device will have DHCP Client installed by default
		
		1) Client device sends "DHCP Discover" msg when connected to network
			- DHCP Discover is a broadcast message (to every device on network)
			- DHCP Discover client: 0.0.0.0 (Want to know identity)
			
		2) DHCP Server on network will receive DHCP Discover message
			- DHCP Server sends "DHCP Offer" message
			- DHCP Offer contains IP address to client
		
		3) DHCP Client will process the DHCP Offer & the provided IP address
			- DHCP Client will send DHCP Request, if IP address is ok
			- Will Request for that Offer to be accepted
			
		4) DHCP Server will acknowledge the Request and assign the IP Address to Client
			- Subnet mask | Gateway | etc. will be sent in DHCP Acknowledge message
			- Client will configure its TCP/IP network based on info provided
			
		* client becomes live entity over network
