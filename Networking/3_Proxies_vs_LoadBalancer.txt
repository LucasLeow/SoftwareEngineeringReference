Proxy Server:
	- A server that acts as intermediary
	- between client requesting resource & server providing that resource
	
	
Client <-> Proxy Server <-> Resource Server

Purpose:

	- Protect clients
	- Proxy server will help get the request instead of direct contact with the client
	- acts as filter / shield / firewall
	
	- Multiple clients can use single Proxy server
		- can help consolidate request before making request
	
	- Proxy also helps in caching (Performance)
		- if content static, can store in cache
		- Any other client requesting same resource will draw from cache
			- instead of making new call to resource server
			
	- Encryption & Decryption of Request
		- hides sensitive data / requests	
			- ip address is masked from resource server
			

Reverse Proxy
	- Server side instead of client side
	- Protects resource server
	
	- Multiple Resource Servers can connect to single proxy
	
	- Instead of exposing servers to clients, uses reverse proxy to face outside world
	
	- Allows for load balancing
		- All data passed to reverse proxy server
		- reverse proxy server helps to balance load, distributing work equally to all servers
	
	- Also provides caching for static content
	
	- Compress request size, increasing bandwidth & performance
	
	
Load Balancer vs Reverse Proxy

	- Reverse Proxy can be load balancer but primary purpose is for security
	- Load Balancer primary goal is to balance load and no extra features
