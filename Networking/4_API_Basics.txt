API : Application Programming Interface

- Interface which allows communication between 2 apps

	Own App -> Request -> Other App
	
	Other App -> Response -> Own App
	
Requirements:

	Other App has developed API so that Own App can access
	
	
	
Eg: Coffee Machine

Own App (Self)
Other App (Coffee Machine)
API (Choices - Buttons)

	API: (endpoints)
		/latte
		/americano
		/mocha
		
	- use functionalities without bothering about implementation / logic
	

Real world API Scenario:



Client (own computer) -> Request -> Internet -> API -> Backend Server -> Database


eg:

	Signing up with new website
	- Choice to login with Facebook / Google
		- utilizing FB / Google's Auth API
		- Auth API connects to Backend Server to check logic then returns token
		
		
Benefits:
	- Hides Complexity
	- Extends functionality
	- Security
	- Access Data
	
	- Own App don't have to code logic provided by API
	- Makes user life easier
