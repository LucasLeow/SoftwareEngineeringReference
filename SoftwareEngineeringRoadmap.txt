            - Superbase
        
        Comes with:
            - Database | UserAuth | Data uploads

        Next.js | Sveltekit | Express
            - to connect to Front-end using Routes

    Alternatives to JS Backend: 
        Java (Spring Boot)
        Ruby on Rails
        Laravel (PHP) 
    
2) Mobile Developer
    - IoS vs Android
    - Have own dedicated toolchain

    IoS: XCode IDE
        - Swift Programming Language

    Android: Android Studio
        - Java
        - Kotlin

    Backend storage:
        - Firebase | AWS amplify
    
    if want build for both platforms, need to learn both language
