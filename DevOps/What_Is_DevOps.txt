- Software Engineering 2 departments
	1) Dev Team
		- Develop Plan
		- Design System
		- Build System  
		
		
	2) Ops Team
		- Testing & Implementation
		- Gives feedback to Dev Team
			- Bugs
			- Rework required
	
	
	Problem:
		- Dev Team waits for Ops Team to do testing & feedback
		- causes delay & inefficiency
		- Dev team may proceed to next project
			- implementing feedback gets pushedback
			
		
	
	Solution:
		- Dev team & Ops team work hand-in-hand
		
		* DevOps approach
		
			- continuous improvement & efficiency
			- faster update to dev changes
			
			- several phases with several tools
			
				DevOps Lifecycle:
				
					Phase 1: Planning Phase (Dev Team) (1 to 4)
						- Dev team lay out plans
							- app objectives to be delivered to clients
							
					Phase 2: Coding Phase 
						- Dev team begin working on code
						- version control used to have different version of code
						
					Phase 3: Built Phase
						- Code is built using built-tools
							- Maven
							- Gradle
						
					Phase 4: Test Phase
						 - Code tested for bugs / errors
							- Selenium (Automated testing)
					
					Phase 5: Deployment Phase (Pass to Ops team)
						- After code tested, passed to Ops Team
					
					Phase 6: Operate Code
						- Code deployed in working environment
							- Docker
							- Kubernetes
							- Ansible
					
					Phase 7: Operation Monitoring
						- Ensure smooth operations
							- Nagios (to automate)
						
						*Feedback received send back to Phase 1 (Planning Phase)
