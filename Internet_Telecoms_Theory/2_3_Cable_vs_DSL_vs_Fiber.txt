3 Internet Access Technologies
	- cable
	- DSL
	- fiber
	
	
	
== Cable Internet ==

	- Uses cable modem with coaxial cable connection
	- linked to ISP (cable television to customer)
	- leverages on existing infrastructure from cable TV
		- cover large areas
	- 25 Mbps to 400 Mbps
	
	
	- ISP will send "Gateway" hardware
		- Gateway = Modem + Router + Switch (All-in-one)
		
	- Coaxial cable connected to Gateway
	- Modem brings internet to home
	- Router + switch allow for multiple device connections
	
	Disadvantage:
		- All homes using the same cable from same ISP share bandwidth
		- during peak hours, will be very slow
		



== DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) Internet ==

	- Utilizes telephone lines
	- carries both voice & internet data over telephone lines
	- has DSL modem, connected to telephone line
	
	- Not to be confused with dial-up connection (also use telephone lines)
		- but much slower
		- can only talk on phone or use internet
		
	- DSL can use phone while connected to internet
	
	- Not as fast as cable
	- cheaper
	- bandwidth not shared
	- widely available than cable
	
	- 5 Mbps to 100 Mbps

	
	* Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL)
		- Download speed faster than upload speed
		- mainly used in homes
		- cheapest form of DSL
	
	* Symmetric Digital Subscriber Line (SDSL)
		- Download & upload speed same
		- mainly used in businesses
	
	* Very High bit DSL (VDSL)
		- Uses copper wire
		- only for short distances
		- ~3 times faster than ADSL
		
		
		
		
== Fiber Internet ==
	- fastest internet speeds
	- 1000 Mbps download / upload
	- uses light to send data through fiber optic cables
	
	- fiber can travel much longer distances
		- light signals not affected by EMI
	
	- More expensive 
	- relatively new
	- infrastructure not ready yet
	- may not be available in many locations
