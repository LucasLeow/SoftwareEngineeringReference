Phone's Microphone:
	- To capture voice input
	- Turns voice (analog) into digital signal
		- using MEMs sensor & IC chip
		
Antenna:
	- Receives the digital signal from microphone
	- Transmits signal using EM wave
		- 0 bits : Low frequencies
		- 1 bits : High frequencies
		
	* EM Wave cannot travel far distances
		- interferance / obstructions
		- Earth curvature
		
	Solution: Cell towers
		- Cellular technology
		
		- Each place on Earth scattered with cell towers
		- Cell towers are connected via optical cables
		- optic fiber cables underground / underwater
		
	- EM Wave intercepted by Cell Tower
	- Converted to light pulses
	- Transported to destination tower
	- Destination tower emits EM Wave to recipient phone
	- Reverse process to obtain digital signal to analog (sound signal)
	
	
How does signal know the "Destination tower" ?
	- Through help from Mobile Switching Center (MSC)
	- Many Cell towers linked to a MSC
	
	
	When purchase SIM Card, info is stored in <Home MSC>
		Info includes:
			- Service plans
			- Current location
			- activities 
			
		* If move to far away from home MSC, will switch to foreign MSC
		Foreign MSC will communicate with Home MSC
		Home MSC will always know which MSC area user is in
		
		How does Home MSC detect location of user?
			1) Update User location after certain period
			2) Update user location after passing pre-defined Cell tower(s)
			3) When cellphone is turned on, update will occur
			
			
Every user assigned to unique frequency
	- However, limited frequency band / range / values
	
	Solution:
		1) Frequency Slot Distribution
			- Diff. frequency slots allocated to different cell towers
			
		2) Multiple Access Technique
			- frequency slot distributed to all users in cell area
			
			

Mobile Generations:
	1G : Carry phone without cable
		- wireless transmission in analog format (easily altered by external sources)
		- Frequency Division Multiple Access technique (inefficient use of spectrum)
		
	2G : use digital Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) technique
		- or Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)
		- Data service + SMS + internet browsing began
	
	3G : - touch screen (Apple iphone 1)
		- WideBand Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA) technique
		- increased Data speed
		- GPS | Video | Voice call
		- rise of modern smart phones
		
	4G: Data speed : 20 - 100 Mbps
		- watching movies / videos possible
		- Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access technique
		- Multi Input Multi Output (MIMO) technique
			- multiple transmitter receiver antenna inside phone & towers
			
	5G : 10 Gbps
		- Enhanced MIMO
		- Support IoT (Smart homes / driverless cars)
