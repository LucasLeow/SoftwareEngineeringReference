Internet:
	- Global computer network
	- devices connected to internet can communicate with each other
	- original purpose was sharing of information
	- Interconnected networks using standardized communication protocols


Data Center contains information

	- webpages
	- videos
	- data in webpages etc.
	
How does data reach target audience?


	In simplest way:
		- through satellite
		- signal from data center -> Satellite -> User's mobile phone / computer
		
		Problem:
			- Distance from data center to satellite far away
			- causes huge latency
			
	
	Typical way:
		- using optical fiber network
		- Massive optical fiber network laid out world wide
		
		- Mobile device / computer may be connected to cellular data / wifi
		
		
		eg: User watch video from youtube
		
			1) Video is stored in SSD inside data center's server
				- server purpose to serve content when requested upon
				
			2) Every device connected to a network is assigned an IP Address
				- Internet Service Provider will assign the IP Address 
				
			3) Server in Data Center also has IP Address
				- Content stored in Server access via call to its IP Address
				- typically domain names (so users don't have to remember IP Address)
				
					youtube.com : 208.65.153.238
					facebook.com : 66.220.149.25
					amazon.com : 72.21.211.176
					paypal.com : 173.0.84.3
					
				* Server has capability to store multiple websites
					- websites cannot be accessed with server's IP address
					- host headers must be used to uniquely identify website
					
				* For large websites (facebook / youtube), entire data center dedicated for them.
					
			4) Domain Name System (DNS) used to keep track of domain names tied to IP address
				- DNS Server managed by internet service provider
				
				
				
			Steps:
				1) User enter domain name in web browser
				2) Browser sends request to DNS Server to get IP Address
				3) Browser forwards the request to the IP Address (server in data center)
				4) data from SSD transmitted digitally via optical fiber cables (light pulses)
				5) Light pulses may have to travel thousands of miles
					- through rough terrain & under sea
					- large companies (AT&T, Verizon, Google etc.) maintains these cables
					- Optical fiber network backbone of internet
					
					eg: SEA-ME-WE3 cable
						- SouthEastAsia-MiddleEast-WesternEurope 3  cable
						- Led by France Telecom & China Telecom, administered by Singtel
						- 39000 km using Wavelength Division Multiplexing 
				
				6) optical cable connected to home router
				7) Router converts optical signals to electric signals
				8) The electric signal is then transmitted via ethernet cable to computer
				
				* If using wirelessly:
				
					Cellular:
						- Optical signal reaches cell tower
						- cell tower converts to electrics signal then to EM Wave
						- EM Wave transmit to wireless device 
						
					Wifi:
						- Wifi Router connected to Modem (ISP)
						- Wifi Router will emit radio wave, transmitting data from modem
