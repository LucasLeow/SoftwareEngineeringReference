Large Fiber Optic Network across the world
	- very long fiber optic cables are laid across the world
	

== How Fiber Optic cable works ==
	- 1 cable made up of thousands of fiber strands
	- single strand as thin as human hair
	
	* refraction:
		- bending of light waves due to different density materials
		- concept used in optical fiber cables
		
	* Total Internal Reflection
		- By making material such that light does not refract
		- but reflect instead
		- Light bounces within material
		
		(Cylindrical tube carrying light signal)
			- regardless of shape of cable, light is internally reflected
			- allow light signals to travel long distances
			
	* Cladding used to cover the core tube
		- to ensure total internal reflection
	
	* Protective film placed over cladding
	
	* In between cables, amplifiers used to amplify light signal
		- signal weaken due to attenuation
		- amplifier draws power from nearby sources
	
	
	
== How Light signal transmit data ==
	
	- User transmitted data converted to digital bits
	
	- digital bits moved to antenna, converted to EM Wave
		- High frequency (1) and low frequency (0)
		
	- Cell tower pick up EM Wave
		- if high frequency, light pulse generated
		- if low frequency, no light pulse
		
	- Light pulse travel through fiber optic cables network
		- laid below ground and underwater
		
	- Mechanical structure to protect fiber cable
	- Copper shell cladding over the fiber cables provide electric power
		- for amplifiers
		

Optical cable benefits
	- higher bandwidth
	- does not cause EMI
	- No side entry of light through optic fiber cable (data safe)
