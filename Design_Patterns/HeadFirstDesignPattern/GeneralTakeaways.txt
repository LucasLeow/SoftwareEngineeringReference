1. Knowing OO basics does not make you a good OO designer
2. Good OO designs are reusable, extensible & maintainable
3. Patterns show you how to build systems with good OO design qualities
4. Patterns are proven OO designs that work
5. Patterns don't give code. They give design solutions to design problems
6. Most Patterns & principles address issues of change in software
7. Most patterns allow some part of system to vary independently of all other parts
8. We often try to identify what varies in the system & encapsulate it (in an interface / class)
9. Pattern provides shared vocab to maximize value when communicating with other devs


OO Basics
    - Abstraction
    - Encapsulation
    - Polymorphism
    - Inheritance

OO Principles
    - Encapsulate what varies (see 1_Strategy Pattern)
    - Favour composition over inheritance (Implementation)
    - Program to Interfaces, not implementations (see 1_Strategy Pattern)
